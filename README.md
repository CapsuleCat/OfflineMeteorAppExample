An example application demonstrating how to serve a static Meteor app.

[See it served via Github IO Pages](http://capsulecat.github.io/StaticMeteorAppExample)

[See how it's done on the Capsule Cat Blog](http://blog.capsulecat.com/2016/01/28/offline-meteor-apps/)

Protip: Open two tabs in the same browser and watch as Ground DB actively listens to changes on the browser's localstorage. Magic!
